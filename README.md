This repository contains a simple command-line game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, implemented in Python. The game uses the 'random' library to simulate the computer's choices, allowing players to compete against the computer in this classic game.

This project is a fun and straightforward example of using Python's basic programming constructs like loops, conditionals, and the 'random' module. It serves as a great starting point for beginners looking to practice their Python skills.
